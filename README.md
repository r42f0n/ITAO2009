Data Analytics for Business 
Academic Year 2024-2025 
Module Description 
Increasingly, organisations are relying on data analysis   to   interpret   corporate   information when   making   business decisions.   Indeed, timely and appropriate   use of data analytics   is considered a crucial component among organisations that   are committed   to   achieving business success.    This module explores basic   methods   and   concepts   in   data   analytics for analysing and   interpreting data. The module takes   both a theoretical   and   practical   approach   to the   use of data analytics   in   practice. 
A   highlight of the module is the use of   KNIME   software   to   analyse   data   for   decision   making   and evaluative   purposes. Students who successfully complete the module will   be   able   to signal to   potential employers that they   have the theoretical, practical plus   industry-standard   software skills to compete.
Module Content 
The   module   is taught   in two types of lectures, class   lectures and computer sessions.      The   first type (i.e., class lectures) will take   place   in class   where   the   theoretical   background   on data analytics will   be covered.   It takes a   holistic approach to   understanding data   analytics   -   the maturity of data analytics   in   industry;   uncover where, when, and   how it   is   being   used; and   identify whether or not   its use results   in greater   effectiveness,   efficiency   and   performance returns. 
Indicative class lectures contents   include:
•          Small and   Big   Data - Case   study   (e.g.,   Netflix,   Facebook   etc.)
•            Descriptive and inferential   analytics
•          Applications of data analytics   in   business
•          The concept of confidence   intervals and   hypothesis   testing
•          Simple and   multiple   linear   regression   analysis
Computer sessions focus on data analysis, covering   both descriptive   and   predictive   analytics, emphasising on   methods, such as correlation analysis   and   regression analysis.    Computer sessions will be taught through   instructor   led computer workshops   using   KNIME software. 
Indicative computer sessions contents   include:
•            Introduction to KNIME
•          Descriptive   analytics   and   visualisation
•            Correlation   analysis
•            Performance of linear regressions
